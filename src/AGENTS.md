This is the src of the root project (Sheru App Library).
All the frontend logic is handeled here.

Important to know:
APICalls.ts contains all the API calls made throughout the whole application, in order to centralise all HTTP requests
globalFunctions.tsx is supposed to be to the central location for all complex/reusable functions that can be reused across multiple apps
