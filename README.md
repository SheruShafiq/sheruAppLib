### Sauce Feature list (outdated)
1. Convinient sharing using shortened links  
2. Stellar and blazing fast resource searching  
3. Points system to promote legitmacy  
4. Completely anonymouse usage  
5. Non comercial  

---

#### Sauce Product properties

##### Must haves
1. **SHARE DATA** (WHAT IS DATA? DATA: {Resource Name, Resource Value, Resource Description})  
2. Data can be evalunted by other users on its legitimacy.  
   `if (Resource === legit) ? upvote : downvote`  
3. Home feed based off of upvotes.  
4. A report button to report inactive resources that were active before  
5. <del>No accounts system. Anyone can make a post without any signup and comment on it as well. Username will be generated automatically and kept track of locally via cookies.</del>  

#### Nice to have
6. Topic based filtering to be able to look up resources with specific assosciations.  
7. Resource requesting.  
8. Feedbased off "Sauces" where audio based is mustard, more explicit is chili etc

## Things I have learned due to this project
1. Being able to use two remotes simultaneously to push to.  
2. How epic JSON server is  
3. You can make a shitty DB out of Vercel cache (And it worked WOOO IT FEELS SO GOOD)!  
4. MUI doesn't let u do OLED black as body BG (You need to tell it how `!important` it is)  
5. For some messed up reason, iOS (as far as I can tell only iOS) scales your website to make font be 16px. In result destroying every formating. Need to put a meta tag on top to stop that.  
6. GitHUB is an excellent file storage system API, it's free, rate limit of 1K and its fast and easy. So db.json is going there.  
7. Render also doesnt persists for free (bitch), so github api it is.  
8. Node has a maximum string length  
9. What are webworkers, progressive web apps and how to do a loading bar  
10. I might not be as good of a dev as I thought I was  
11. I know very little in the grand scheme of things of web app development and should send a formal appology to both Rein and Erik  
12. position sticky requires top to defined  
13. Web workers are cool as shit, but I dont think I'll have another use case anytime soon.
14. Java is a nightmare to deploy
15. Concurency on scale is tuff (suddenly making Erlang so much cooler than it already was)
16. Bash is very strong and exactly is what I thought python would be.

## Notes of insanity (A log of shit I did, and lost life years over. Think of it as the Caelid of my mind.)

- After multiple hours of scrootny and discovery, I have come to the conclusion, that the problem is in my function and not the makeshift cache backend in vercel cuz it's also breaking in onRender. All be it, onRender does feel a bit more reliable as far as reliablity goes. Need to look into as to why the likes array of user isn't being updated properly.  
- So, after years being take of my life for each export off of badgeMaker. Apparently jsPDF has a bug, the library itself that exports the entire export in a single string, a string so long (when 200+ badges) that node crashes as it exceeds the maximum length. So thank lord, some guy in the tickets made a fork with a fix cuz the bastards themselves refuse to take the PR in.  
- ALSO HOLY SHIT I MANAGED TO MOVE THE WHOLE THING TO TYPESCRIPT  
- I do need to double check some logic, there's too much of "Why would u do that" going on in functions for sauce app.  
- Holy shit balls, figuring out an effecient way to generate DOM elements as PDFs is a bitch. I tried moving the logic to server, as backend languages tend to be multi-threaded and thus capable of doing more compared to abusing the singular UI thread on my browser. But hey, I have some ideas.  
1) **Idea 1:** Lets send the whole DOM over network to the server, that oughta work right? **NOPE.** It's breaking all sorts of styles due to missing inherited styles...  
2) **Idea 2:** Alright, what if I rewrote the whole thing in HTML/CSS in the backend? Inconsistentâ€”so inconsistent compared to what's on the frontend. It's actually embarassing.  
3) **Idea 3:** Okay okay hold on. **PUPPETEER!** Let's have some headless clients running in the backend using Node andâ€”**STFU.** Why the fuck would you just replicate the problem you have in the frontend in the backend?  
- Okay, webworkers. Holy shit. **SO** cool, but my god the useâ€‘cases are far and few between. Regardless, I am extremely happy with the fact that I got â€™em working. PDF generation time is almost half when the work is divided on 2 worker threads. All be it, the issue regarding the browser slowing down when the window isn't focused continues, and might only be resolved via Electron. Need to figure that out yet tho.  
- Implemented a nicer Excel input that supports pasting spreadsheet rows and logs all input to the database.  
- **Idea (Hans):** Hans also low key cooked. What if I made an image of the BG once, sent that to backend and let it loop over that image. That would be THE fastest way to generate badges. Some downsides thoâ€”it's not gonna be as accurate, cuz now shit's not calculated anymore.
- Jesus fucking christ, I spent, no kidding. 9 hours. Browsing the web, scrolling documentations of backend frameworks, trying to understand and choose the best one. Holy shit. Id rather have a heel in my kneehole next time, than have to choose a techstack ever again.
Silverlining: I have sources to back up my steamy turds on every backend framework ever. But yeah here's a short summary of my 9 hour journey:
So, in this fucked up adventure through the gullag. My requirements were as fowllows:
1) I want realtime pub/sub connection
2) I want it to be cheap, ideally stick to big ol Zero.
3) I want it to easily deployable (Dont look up how to deploy a JAVA application. Just get take cock and ball torture instead. NEVER ATTEMPT TO DEPLOY A JAVA APPLICATION).
So yeah, with some additional context and requirements reasoning, I started the deep search thing on GPT and started looking into niches myself that GPT usually doesnt consider.
GPT came up with some damn nice options (see the table in the bottom, in the future section.) So I kept arguing back and forth on each of them. Concurency, active connection limit, pricing, scaling. Intergration with React.
Integration with Vercel. Self hosting, cloud provider bla bla. And finnalyy setteled on firestore. Until moments later during a test setup, I realised that Iam gonna have to reuse my nightmare architecture because the DB is NoSQL.
So I switched back to Supabase, because it had more or less the Firebase package, just with SQL. Which then also got dropped moments later because of a miserably low concurrent user limit and cheapo free tier.
So I finnalyy caved and went with Convex. Even though its NoSQL, since it doesnt charge per query. My data assembly costs should stay down. It works wonders with React (almost made for it), and is supa easy to deploy.
Currently playing around with it in another repo. As soon as I have the API(s) live, then I'll start the migration fully.

# Future

**26/05/2025**  
After a lot, and I mean **ALOT**, of research and stressing ChatGPT deepâ€‘research to its limitsâ€”and driving a guy on Stack Overflow to the top of Burj Khalifa with questionsâ€”I have decided to make two drastic changes:  
- Move the app to **Next.js**  
- <del>Use Google's **Firestore**</del> NEVER THE FUCK MIND. IT doesnt have joins. DO you have any idea the sheer amounts of reads I'd have to do for a single user scrolling for 10 minutes on a nonSQL db? TOO MANY.
- Use Convex as backend

### My reasoning

The following were the contenders for the potential backend.

| # | Option | Why? | Why not? |
|---|--------|------|----------|
| 1 | Java (Spring Boot) | Would be a great learning experience, plus it aligns nicely with my uni stuff. Plenty of libraries to work with. Fast as they come. | It's a nightmare to host. I would rather have heels in my kneehole than attempt to host a Java application ever again. |
| 2 | Phoenix LiveView | Because it's cool as all hell. As far as I can tell, the best backend framework as far as typical backend frameworks go. And of course, **BEAM**. | LiveView is cool as shit but it's not React. It's simply too niche to learn. |
| 3 | Convex | Works excellently with React. Doesnt charge per read or write but CPU sost per query, so I can get away with multiple queries as long as they are lightweight... compared to firestore, which charges per query. Literally the **DREAM** backend framework from what I can tell. Very cool codeâ€‘based everything. | Same problem as LiveViewâ€”too niche. And the company is going in a weird direction with the whole AI hype. I would love to use it for something else at some point. But yeah... I'm realising I don't have a very good reason to say no. So my reason is that the vibes <del>are</del> were off. WE ARE ON BABAAYYY |
| 4 | Supabase | Modern DB solution. Has all the fancy bells and whistles. Realtime as wellâ€”very cool and poggies in all regards. | **MAXIMUM REALTIME CONCURRENT CONNECTIONS ON FREE TIER IS 200. WHICH IS FINE. CUZ AT LEAST IT HAS SQL.** Too expensive tho. Convex is cheaper.  |
| 5 | Firebase | Supabase but **better** | Vendor lock. (Who cares???? Not me.) AND THE FACT THAT ITS NoSQL Makes it COMPLETELY useless for a social media app on scale. |

<del>So yeah. That's why Firebase. It's also, yk, Google. So the knowledge value is waaay higher than Convex.</del>
Nope nope nope nope NOPE. Good god. What was I thinking. 
Anyway now its between Supabase and convex. So yeah lets see.
I have seen; I am going with Convex. It simply makes too much sense. The pricing is better. The DX is more fun. Yes, I probably wont be using it for work anytime soon. But good god its good.

As for wtf is up with Next.js? React is perfectly fine, right?  
Well... There are **a lot** of really nice features that I would otherwise have to implement myself:

- SSR / SSG  
- Image optimisation  
- Never having to expose serverâ€‘side logic, etc.  

It just makes no sense to skip on all of that when it's figured out **out of the box**.  
Plus security, scalability, etc.

So yeahâ€”**Next.js** and <del>**Firestore**</del> Convex are the backend stack I have settled on for now. Will start working on migration to NextJs right away via a test project. Get my hands warmed up. And the will attempt to move this project.

**26/04/2025â€“13/05/2025Â [DONE]**  
I am far too happy with the setup of this websiteâ€”the frontend, I mean. So happy, in fact, that I want to make it an Apps library, where Sauce and badgeMaker are two of the apps.  
I want to be able to host all sorts of apps here: my own CV with a GIF for a pfp like those Harry Potter newspapers, any tool I need (like a PasteBin or something), or just anything cool reallyâ€”whatever tools I use on a regular basisâ€”and then make a fullâ€‘fledged little web app store of apps of my own.

#### Yes. Sauce is inspired by the *sixâ€‘digit sauce*.
