> _A community driven resource sharing application_

**Sauce** is a simple application developed solely for research purposes. **Sauce** aims to provide it's users
with a convinient access to resources that may be harder to find via manual browsing. The reason I started this project was
for the frontend exam at Uni. Hence the funny backend, that will be replaced with a proper one when I get to backend exam.

The application's prominent features are:

1. Convinient sharing using shortened links
2. Stellar and blazing fast resource searching
3. Points system to promote legitmacy
4. Completely anonymouse usage
5. Non comercial

### **Design**

Product properties

> Must haves

1. SHARE DATA (WHAT IS DATA? DATA: {Resource Name, Resource Value, Resource Description})
2. Data can be evalunted by other users on its legitimacy.
   if (Resource === legit) ? upvote : downvote
3. Home feed based off of upvotes.
4. A report button to report inactive resources that were active before
5. <del>No accounts system. Anyone can make a post without any signup and comment on it as well. Username will be generated automatically and kept track of locally via cookies.</del>

> Nice to have 6. Topic based filtering to be able to look up resources with specific assosciations. 7. Resource requesting. 8. Feedbased off "Sauces" where audio based is mustard, more explicit is chili etc

#### _Will use JSON server till I get to the backend exam._

### Things I have learned due to this project

1. Being able to use two remotes simultaneously to push to.
2. How epic JSON server is
3. You can make a shitty DB out of Vercel cache (And it worked WOOO IT FEELS SO GOOD)!
4. MUI doesn't let u do OLED black as body BG (You need to tell it how `!important` it is)
5. for some messed up reason, iOS (as far as I can tell only iOS) scales your website to make font be 16px. In result destroying every formating. Need to put a meta tag on top to stop that.
6. GitHUB is an excellent file storage system API, it's free, rate limit of 1K and its fast and easy. So db.json is going there.
7. Render also doesnt persists for free (bitch), so github api it is.
8. Node has a maximum string length
9. What are webworkers, progressive web apps and how to do a loading bar
10. I might not be as good of a dev as I thought I was
11. I know very little in the grand scheme of things of web app development and should send a formal appology to both Rein and Erik
12. position sticky requires top to defined
13. Web workers are cool as shit, but I dont think I'll have another use case anytime soon.

> Notes of insanity (A log of shit I did, and lost life years overw )

- After multiple hours of scrootny and discovery, I have come to the conclusion, that the problem is in
  my function and not the makeshift cache backend in vercel cuz it's also breaking in onRender. All be it, onRender does feel a bit more reliable as far as reliablity goes. Need to look into as to why the likes array of user isn't being updated properly.
- So, after years being take of my life for each export off of badgeMaker. Apparently jsPDF has a bug, the librry itself that exports the entire export in a single string, a string so long (when 200+ badges) that node crashes as it exceeds the maximum
  length. So thank lord, some guy in the tickets made a fork with a fix cuz the bastards themselves refuse to take the PR in.
- ALSO HOLY SHIT I MANAGED TO MOVE THE WHOLE THING TO TYPESCRIPT
- I do need to double check some logic, there's too much of "Why would u do that" going on in functions for sauce app.
- Holy shit balls, figuring out an effecient way to generate DOM elements as PDFs is a bitch. I tried moving the logic to server, as backend languages tend to be multi theaded and this much most compared to abusing the singular UI thread on my browser. But hey, I have some ideas.
- Idea 1: Lets send the whole DOM over network to the server, that oughta work right? NOPE. Its breaking all sorts of styles due to missing inherited styles...
- Idea 2: Alright, what if I rewrote the whole thing in HTML/CSS in the backend. Inconssistent, so inconsistent compared to what's on the frontned. Its actually embarassing.
- Idea 3: Okay okay hold on. PUPETEER! Lets have some headless clients running in the backend using Node, an- STFU. Why the fuck would you just replicate the problem you have in the frontend in the backend. Its litteraly what ARM did, they moved the pain from x86 to software instead. 
- Okay, webworkers. Holy shit. SO cool, but my god the usecase are far and few between. Regardless, Iam extremely happy with the fact that I got em working. PDF generation time is almost half when the work is divided on 2 worker threads. All be it, the issue
  regarding the browser slowing down when window not focused continues, and might only be resolved via Electron. Need to figure that out yet tho. 
Was a bitch to setup... thanks Claude.
- Implemented a nicer Excel input that supports pasting spreadsheet rows and logs all input to the database.
- Idea (Hans): Hans also low key cooked, what if I made an image of the BG once, sent that to backend and let is loop over that image. That would be THE fastest way to generate badges. Some downsides tho, its not gonna be as accurate, cuz now shtits not caluclated anymore.

> # Future

I am far too happy with the setup of this website, the frontend I mean. So happy in fact that I want to make it an Apps library. Where sauce and badgeMaker are one of the apps.
I want to be able to host all sorts of apps here, my own CV with a GIF for a pfp like those harry potter newspapers, any tool I need like a pasteBin or something?
Or just anything cool really, whatever tools I use on a regular basis, and then make a full fledged little web app store of apps of my own.

#### Yes. Sauce is inspired from the 6 digit sauce.
